Unlike the Drone, ScaraBee only records up to one minute of VGA video. It does drive for 15 minutes on a charge.

While no bank records or personally identifiable information have been stolen from any bank, customers have been complaining of slow or unusable online banking services."^1^"The attacks are coming in the form of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks launched by networked computers in data centers. That<squote>s a level above less sophisticated DDoS attacks, which are commonly orchestrated like this: First, hackers gain control of a commandable network of <dquote>bot<dquote> computers by spreading a virus that infects thousands of unsuspecting computer owners. Then, they turn those machines into weapons, pointing a great deal of bogus traffic at a particular website in the hopes of overloading and crashing the target server.But where are these attacks coming from? Responsibility for many of them has been claimed by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Cyber Fighters, which say they<squote>re unaffiliated with any government. However, according to United States government officials cited in a recent New York Times report, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam is likely a front for Iran<squote>s cyberwarfare efforts. "^1.4^"That makes some degree of sense: Iran has reason to be retaliating in cyberspace after it was hit with U.S. and Israel-backed computer viruses. The Times report claims the attacks<squote> sophistication identifies them as state-sponsored.

Could the same offer soon be extended to movies and books?"^1.66666666666667^"The answer, unfortunately, is probably not."^1^"The first issue is cost. Sarah Rotman Epps, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, says Amazon has sold so many books they couldn<squote>t feasibly afford to subsidize e-book copies of past (nor, for that matter, future) purchases; the number of CDs Amazon has sold is, by comparison, marginal.

After all, the device was created to run a version of Windows that runs on ARM-based processors instead of the usual x86 chips that had powered all Windows machines before it."^1^"That inherently limited the Surface RT by preventing it from running legacy Windows apps. Windows 8 had to stand on its own, without the safety net of the classic desktop environment (it still exists on the device, it just can<squote>t run much of anything). That could be why the new operating system has apparently struggled to catch on."^1^"That might change with the Surface Pro (starting at $899). This, of course, is the version of the tablet that packs an Intel Core i5 processor instead of the ARM-based Tegra 3. Thanks to that CPU, the Surface Pro can run apps designed for Windows 7 or even older versions of Windows. Photoshop, iTunes, you name it — you can do it on this machine."^1^1.4

Some items make it into the cart, others do not. Thanks to the check-out counter, retailers know when something’s been bought, but not much about what made you stop and choose it in the first place. Now, 3D sensing technology may offer an unlikely, yet powerful, solution."^1.5^"In a small suite adjacent to the massive CES 2013 convention hall, Primesense and partner Shopperperception showed me a rather remarkable technology that uses the former’s 3D sensing technology, and an iPad-based analytics app to give retailers an aggregated view of what shoppers are doing at store shelves."^1^"Primesense, which unveiled its tiny Capri 3D sensor at the show, also provides the 3D sensing technology for Microsoft’s Kinect for the Xbox 360.  Its low-cost, tiny motherboards bathe the area in front of it in an infrared 3D mesh that a second camera interprets.  It’s how interactive games know not only where multiple people are in a room, but also exactly what each of them is doing. It’s obviously super useful for virtual dancing and driving, but as Primsense demonstrated to me, the open platform can do far more than just play games."^1.5^1.52941176470588

"^1.33333333333333^"Yet, the CD is still the predominant format for music buying. Consumers bought 193 million CDs in 2012 vs. 118 million digitally downloaded albums, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Though digital continues to grow at a rapid clip, it will probably be a couple of years before CD buyers become the minority.

The reason for its removal? CBS is currently suing Dish for its ability to skip commercials, a feature that<squote>s included in the Hopper set-top box."^1.33333333333333^"A spokesperson for CBS Corp. acknowledged in an email to Mashable Monday morning that the DVR was made ineligible for the award <dquote>due to active litigation involving our parent company CBS Corp.<dquote> Going forward, CNET staffers are not only forbidden to nominate products involved in litigation with CBS Corp. for award shows and other accolades, but also to review them, the spokesperson wrote. A similar statement was posted at the bottom of the page that hosted the livestream of the award announcements late last week, and on a (favorable) review of the Hopper box published just five days ago."^0.5^"To impose such a policy on a publication like CNET — whose primary product is in-depth, unbiased reviews on a wide variety of hardware — isn<squote>t just problematic; it<squote>s also a poor business decision. It undermines the credibility of the entire CNET operation, doing little damage to Dish Network in the process.

Kevin elected to go with the one-handed, over-handed, quarterback-style toss but the end result was even more incredible than any swish.

On The Feed website, meanwhile, users will also be able to look at photos of trending topics sorted by region. Yvonne Chien, the company<squote>s senior vice president of marketing, says the move<squote>s goals are twofold — to drive more Getty subscriptions and image purchases, as well as elevate the brand<squote>s profile and visibility with normal Internet surfers simply hungry for visual content to look at.

"^2^"Lechowski<squote>s film, titled R<squote>ha, is a fully computer animated six-minute short that you won<squote>t believe was made by just one student. In R<squote>ha, machines rebel against their rulers, an alien species, and force them out of their planet. The short starts with a robot interrogating one of the aliens after the Matrix-style insurrection. Perhaps R<squote>ha<squote>s most original element is that there are no humans in sight. The story seems to be only about this alien race and their former servant robots who have turned on them."^1^"Despite being the work of a student, R<squote>ha is so good it<squote>s already attracted the attention of Hollywood executives.

"^2^"Disney Infinity, which is currently in development with Avalanche Software and will debut in June, will feature 17 plastic characters — and 40 interactive pieces — from both Disney and Pixar movies to power the game. The toys will focus on upcoming film Monsters University, as well as The Incredibles and Pirates of the Caribbean. It will also come with a base, so when figures are placed on top, they can play certain experiences. Meanwhile, each film has its own Playset (or gaming universe) that can combine up to three characters from other films."^1.5^"However, the company stressed its more of an interactive gaming platform than just a typical game.

Even so, the figure stands at $206.8 per man-hour, above the previous year’s mark of 201. For Vanguard to stay in business, says Budnick, the figure has to go up by 1% or more every year. There’s only one way get there: produce more while working less."^1.6^"That is why Budnick is now considering adding a new member to his team: a robot called Baxter.

(Those numbers have been driven up by some outliers, like the aforementioned Amazon and eBay, which have mobile sales in the billions, per Forrester<squote>s estimates.) For most U.S. retailers, mobile represents only 1.5% of online sales.

The following are some key ways businesses are getting an extra boost via mobile apps."^2^"Back in 2010, then-Google CEO Eric Schmidt talked about how the future of mobile would be autonomous and serendipitous. That is, mobile devices would present users with information about the world around them in an automatic way. In Schmidt’s example, as he walked around a particularly storied neighborhood of San Francisco, an app would passively display information about the history of places he passed. But the technology has become a reality, and a boon to business. Here are some ways businesses could use geo-targeted push notifications."^1.2^"One of the single biggest opportunities for businesses to leverage mobile apps is that smartphones have opened a whole new world of shopping and engagement opportunities. Interactions between customers and businesses have grown to become geo-agnostic. The morning commute, waiting in line for movie tickets and sitting in a doctor<squote>s office are all places people could be using their smartphones to shop your store or engage with your brand."^1.66666666666667^1.54
