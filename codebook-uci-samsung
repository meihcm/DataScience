The following data wrangling was made to produce tidy-uci-samsung.csv
** The file contains the AVERAGE of each dimension of measurements (86 vectors/measurements) grouped by subject + activities.
** The average was taking from both the test and training sets
** First three columns are: subjectKey, activityLabel, activityKey
** Next 86 vectors/columns are:

=== Steps to produce (see run_analysis-uci-samsung.R for R script) ===
To build the full TEST_Y_DATA table, the following was done:
1. Brought in activity_labels.txt with column names activityKey and activityLabel
2. Brought in y_test.txt and merge with the activity_lables by activityKey
3. Create the full table by column binding subject_test.txt with #2 above.
4. Brought in X_test.txt and have the column names (561 columns) mapped from features.txt
5. Created TEST_Y_DATA from doing the bind of #3, and #4

To build the full TRAIN_Y_DATA table, the following was done:
6. Brought in activity_labels.txt with column names activityKey and activityLabel
7. Brought in y_train.txt and merge with the activity_lables by activityKey
8. Create the full table by column binding subject_train.txt with #7 above.
9. Brought in X_train.txt and have the column names (561 columns) mapped from features.txt
10. Created TRAIN_Y_DATA from doing the bind of #8, and #9

Merge data:
11. A row bind was used to merge both TRAIN_Y_DATA and TEST_Y_DATA.
12. Follow by applying a filter for only columns that contain std or mean (standard deviation and mean measurements)
